It's rock paper scissors, what else do you want me to say? Gonna add a bunch of modded versions later,
like a lizard and spoch version from big bang theory, double or nothing, and a more dynamic version
using ASCll art. I always wanted to be a animation youtuber but don't have the work ethic to follow 
through on it. 

Anyways this project and a few others I post later are copied from Al Sweigart's books and stuff and I
will add modded versions so I can get out of tutoriel hell.
